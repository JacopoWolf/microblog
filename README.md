### Requirements

A TypeScript compiler is required to build the JavaScript necessary for the WebPage to work.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. *if you want you can install the typescript compiler globally* <br> `npm install -g typescript`
3. from *src/main/typescript* run `npm ci` to install dependencies
4. start the compiler by simply running `tsc`


### Notes

- Swagger documentation is at `/rest/swagger.json`

- If you don't have Java 14 i suggest you update `<java.version>` in your `pom.xml` to solve compilation issues.
